Projection of the Next 22 Days

<p>My model uses Encounter Density <i>D</i> to determine Reproductive Number <i>R</i>. This is the most fundamental assumption of the model.</p>
(Encounter Density <i>D</i> data source: Unacast's Social Distancing Scoreboard, which derives the probability that two cell phone devices that were in the same place at the same time)

<p>The strong relation between <i>R</i> and <i>D</i> is evident in this figure.</p>

<p><img src=R_D.png alt=DNC width="800"></p>
<p>Shown in red is "Daily Reproductive Number" <i>R_d</i>. By definition, if today's daily new cases in <i>N</i>, tomorrow's number will be <i>N*R_d</i>. Hence, the ultimate goal is to keep <i>R_d</i> under 1.</p>

<p>The black dots are Adjusted Encounter Density <i>D_adj</i>, shifted forward by 22 days. 
These two curves are remarkably close. For example, <i>R</i> started to quickly decrease at around 3/20. This coincides with a sudden decrease of <i>D</i> at the end of Feb, ~20 days before. <i>R</i> reached bottom at ~4/15 and stayed at the level till ~5/15. This overlaps with low <i>D</i> between 3/20 to 4/20. 
The amount of shift is optimized to maximize overlap, and the value is determined as 22 days. 
The values are normalized to pre-pandamic levels, so 1.0 means activity level before pandemic hit US.
